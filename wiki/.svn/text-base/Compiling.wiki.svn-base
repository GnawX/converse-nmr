= Getting the code =

You can download the code by SVN:
{{{
svn checkout http://converse-nmr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ converse-nmr
}}}

= Compiling the code =

Enter the `converse-nmr` directory and type:
{{{
./configure [--enable-parallel] [F90=...] [F77=...] [CC=...] [LIBDIRS="..."]
}}}
where `LIBDIRS` is a list of directories, separated by spaces, to search
for missing libraries (BLAS, LAPACK, MKL, FFTW, ...). Optionally, you can
edit `make.sys` to fine tune the compilation options.

For a more in-depth guide to configuring and compiling the code, read the
[http://www.quantum-espresso.org/user_guide/user_guide.html Quantum-Espresso user's guide].

Finally, you can build the code by:
{{{
make pw pp
}}}
