Here you can find short tutorials on how to calculate the NMR shielding tensors
and the EPR g-tensor with the _converse_ method.

  * [Compiling Getting and compiling the code]
  * [Input Input variables]
  * [Fluoromethane NMR: Fluoromethane]
  * [Quartz NMR: Quartz]
  * [H2CN EPR: H2CN radical]

=== Pseudopotentials ===

The current implementation of the converse method works only with norm-conserving
pseudopotentials. We have generated some GIPAW pseudopotentials ready for use. You can find them [https://sites.google.com/site/dceresoli/pseudopotentials here]. If
you need to generate new pseudopotentials, you can follow the instructions at
[http://www.impmc.jussieu.fr/~software/gipaw/index.html].

We will appreciate if you could share your pseudopotential with the GIPAW community
by sending them to us. We will then upload the pseudopotentials to this site.
