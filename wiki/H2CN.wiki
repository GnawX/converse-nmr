= Introduction =

To calculate the EPR g-tensor is sufficient to perform three SCF calculation, with
the electron spin aligned along the three cartesian directions. In the current
version of the code, the calculation is collinear. This is a good approximation
for molecule radicals and for ferromagnetic systems.

Here is the input file, `H2CN-converse.in.tmpl`:

The spin-orbit interaction is activated by the `lambda_so` variable. You can
run the three calculations with the following shell script:
{{{
#!/bin/sh
pw=$HOME/Codes/converse-nmr/trunk/PW/pw.x
molecule=H2CN
cart=(dummy x y z)

for dir in 1 2 3
do
  base=$molecule-converse-${cart[$dir]}
  sed "s/@DIR@/$dir/" <$molecule-converse.in.tmpl >$base.in
  $pw <$base.in >$base.out
done
}}}

The deviation in ppm of g-tensor from g,,e,,=2.0023318361 can be extracted from the output files by:
{{{
grep "delta_g total" H2CN-converse*.out
H2CN-converse-x.out:     delta_g total      =      3207.8816        0.0000        0.0000
H2CN-converse-y.out:     delta_g total      =         0.0000      -15.4485        0.0000

This g-tensor does not include the spin-other-orbit contribution, which is usually
small. By comparison, a linear response (_classic GIPAW_) calculation, including
the SOO term, yields:
{{{
